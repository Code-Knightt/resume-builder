# Resume Builder

An attempt at building a resume builder in React with support for templates and not having to worry about the layout. Wish to implement templating in the future. Feel free to fork and contribute

- Currently supports desktops with size > 1200px
- To disable prefilled text, set the VITE_FILL env variable to false
